            <h3>Extensive Experience in Public and Private</h3>
            <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52c75952e4b01bdd66a80ef2/t/52c7a386e4b083e90ec06e02/1388815246657/il_fullxfull.350965695.jpg?format=300w">
            
            <p>I have been in private practice since 2005, consulting at Gilgit Road Specialists Centre in Epsom. I am also a Consultant General Surgeon at Middlemore Hospital, where I enjoy my commitment to elective and acute surgery, and training medical staff at all levels. <br><br>
                By working in the public hospital system as well as private practice, I obtain both a high volume of work overall, and maintain my skills in low-volume complex or rare conditions and procedures. <br><br>
                I am accredited to perform surgery at Mercy Hospital, SouthernCross Brightside, Auckland City Surgical, and Ormiston Hospital. </p>

            <p>I consult and operate on a wide range of General Surgical problems, and have specialty interests in melanoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and rare tumors. ACC referrals for hernia are also welcome.</p>

            <h3>Working with Referrers</h3>

            <p>I am excited to offer the services of my private surgical practice. 2010 will be my tenth year as a qualified surgeon. My general surgical interests are fairly broad, and include hernias, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thyroidectomy, and anorectal problems such as haemorrhoids. I am confident that I can cater to most of your patients needs. As mentioned, I also have special expertise in surgical oncology, and will be happy to deal with most ‘common’ surgical cancers, and will refer on to any super-specialists where this is more appropriate.<br><br>
                My goal is to deliver excellent care to your patients. I believe that good communication (with both patients and medical colleagues) is essential to best practice, and intend to be easily contactable. The practice will continue to evolve and respond to your needs and those of our patients.</p>
